This is a web app used to track user conversion rates with modern UI elements and libraries. I created this app in 2024 as a means to re-evaluate efficiency of market tools within the web development ecosystem. The project allowed me to further my knowledge regarding web development modern styles and learn more about user-centered design and data management.
